{"name":"Iota","permission":{"default":0},"type":"star_system","data":{"description":"The planets in Iota orbit a pair of semi-detached binary stars: a yellow sun (Iota-1) and a brown dwarf (Iota-2). By the time the Hegemony arrived, there were two asteroid belts. One of these belts still has a large portion of a shattered planet remaining in its midst. Although both belts were clearly planets once upon a time, nobody is sure what sort of calamity could have shattered them. Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, the Guild wasted no time in setting up the Iota shipyards, which service many ships in the sector.","notables":"Shipyards: While the primary yard is run by the Starsmiths, many smaller, licensed hubs work on repairs and ship refits. These stations are full of bored spacers looking for any distraction from the wait. Starsmiths sometimes hire foolhardy pilots for prototype tests.\n\nBelt of Fire: The region of superheated plasma currents that lies between the Iota binary stars. Spacers spin yarns about the Old Dragon, a vast space creature living there. While the name is whimsical, the Hegemony issued a Quarantine order for the area after several ships disappeared.\n\nWay Line: The Iota gates produce a region between them where engines can produce more thrust, akin to the winds of a planetary sea. The path itself is hard to find and switches direction. Pilots in the know use this to gain an advantage against each other on rush deliveries (or daring escapes).\n\nZX-1138: A long-period comet that recently diverged from its course, taking it much closer to Indri. Reasons for the course change are unclear, but the locals have requested the Governor investigate. Mystics claim this has shifted the system Way Lines, making the Way act unpredictably."},"flags":{},"img":"systems/scum-and-villainy/styles/assets/icons/orbital.png","effects":[],"_id":"GNaI5CZGOPTaGIWo"}
{"name":"Rin","permission":{"default":0},"type":"star_system","data":{"description":"The entry point to the Procyon sector, Rin was colonized a little over a hundred years ago by House Nim-Amar. It has never been an important sector, so Malklaith has never invested more than a minimum of resources in its development. Instead, it is used to train young House members or as an assignment to punish those who fail the House. Galactic law is more present here than the rest of the sector, as this is the seat of sector administration and contains gates to three systems, including a path towards the rest of the Hegemony.","notables":"Aleph: Between the poisonous gasses and tectonic instability, Aleph would be a planet to avoid if not for its mineral stores. Most of the wealth dug from the planet is taxed heavily by the Governor, leading to frequent unrest with the miners.\n\nAshtari Cloud: An Ur ship suffered a mishap here, generating an in-system nebula. Normal propulsion is minimal and nav systems are dodgy. The Maelstrom pirates have figured out how to navigate the cloud and made their base of operations within its protective shroud.\n\nThe Straylight: The latest fad, the Straylight is an upscale club and cocktail bar where elites can wine and dine. It usually orbits Aleph, though it can move to other planets and moons in the system. Its owner, Chance, runs a tight establishment, but things can sometimes get out of hand.\n\nBaftoma (aka The Husk): Resource exploitation by the Hegemony is comprehensive and planets incapable of sustaining life are stripped to their core. Baftoma was one such planet; now only scaffolding of rock remains, its broken form only used by folks hiding or dodging pursuit."},"flags":{},"img":"systems/scum-and-villainy/styles/assets/icons/orbital.png","effects":[],"_id":"OEFlt7NYHci9gWNA"}
{"name":"Brekk","permission":{"default":0},"type":"star_system","data":{"description":"Considered by many to be more civilized than much of the rest of Procyon, this system is home to many of the finer aspects of the Hegemony: education, art, and culture. Wealth and culture means the Legion presence is strong in the sector, protecting the elite. However, there are many odd, non-Starsmith-maintained hyperspace lanes that bend strangely, making long loops perpendicular to planetary orbits. Pilots map these so-called dark lanes, making it easy to dodge patrols if one is willing to take their time and has the skills necessary to navigate them.","notables":"Blackstarr: The vast and largely empty Nightspeaker ship where initiates train for their first year. The ship is unlit and moves routinely to prevent discovery. It does not often receive visitors, though exceptions can be made for those that have a favorable relationship to the Cult.\n\nDendara: An ancient temple on the fifth moon of Nightfall, Todav. Some say it is an Ur temple, others that it is the remains of a forgotten mystic Cult. Its derelict corridors are tough to tour due to the moons lack of atmosphere and the glitching effect the temple has on drives and electronics.\n\nBright Wind: A large gas cloud ejected by the star, now used as a racing grounds by the Echo Wave Riders. Despite it being both lethal and illegal, racers all over the sector compete for cred and fame. Invitations to the races are exclusive and require qualifying in hazardous conditions.\n\nIsotropa Max Secure: Orbiting near the star, Isotropa is the most notorious prison system in Procyon. Wardens broker audiences with prisoners and grant commutations for the powerful and wealthy. They report to Malklaith, but the prison largely runs itself."},"flags":{},"img":"systems/scum-and-villainy/styles/assets/icons/orbital.png","effects":[],"_id":"UIOjC6f1sjUQ8sRH"}
{"name":"Holt","permission":{"default":0},"type":"star_system","data":{"description":"Holt was the second Procyon system to be colonized, though the Rin-Holt gate was troublesome to stabilize. Hegemonic scientists eventually found a series of Ur keys in the system that forced the gate to consistently lead to Holt. The gate remains temperamental, however, and has been known to open on its own. No ships have come through during these spontaneous openings, so far. The Holt system star burns white, though it is far older than stars of this type should be, which Hegemonic scientists attribute to ancient Ur manipulation.","notables":"Jerecs Junkyard: A free-floating mass of ships, parts, and sheeting connected via magnetism and cabling. If you are looking for equipment on the cheap, the Junkyard is your place, though it will likely be missing a piece or unreliable. Jerec also buys, but is a canny haggler.\n\nHantu Gate: The Hegemony has never been able to activate this jumpgate. Compared to other gates, it seems to be missing a few small, but key, pieces. It has been speculated that the Ur locked the gate and hid the keys somewhere, though its anyones guess as to why.\n\nTrade Platform Auto #4: The Guild has set up an automated trading platform for selling fuel, covered in defensive systems to deter theft. Because of this, some parties conduct negotiations here to discourage escalation. Nobody knows what happened to the first three platforms.\n\nPlanet Omega: Three survey crews and one military expedition vanished before the Legion quarantined this planet. It is overrun by a deadly life form that nests within Ur ruins and can resist nukes from orbit. The Hegemony considers it hostile, but insignificant to its plans."},"flags":{},"img":"systems/scum-and-villainy/styles/assets/icons/orbital.png","effects":[],"_id":"qVIkY0adOoLCT3RQ"}
